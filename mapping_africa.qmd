title: "A region-wide, multi-year set of crop field boundary and landcover maps
 for Africa"
---

## Background

This site provides links to view and obtain High resolution cropland and 
landcover maps developed by Clark University's Agricultural Impacts 
Research Group for various African countries (https://agroimpacts.info/).

## Datasets

There are two types of data currently available:

1. **cropland**: Field boundary polygon maps developed using different
supervised and unsupervised deep learning models span the growth and changes
of African agricultural activities since 2018.

2. **landcover**: Maps generated using Random Forests model trained using the
 label data and predictors drawn from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope data.

## Accessing data

### From S3

These datasets can be downloaded from this bucket by AWS account holders. 
Data are stored under the following prefixes:

- croplands
    - pmtiles
    - mbtiles
- landcover/

These can be viewed using the AWS command line interface (CLI):

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://mappingafrica/ --request-payer
```

    PRE croplands/pmtiles/
    PRE croplands/mbtiles/
    PRE landcover/

To download a dataset, hereâ€™s an example command:

```bash
aws s3 cp \
s3://mappingafrica/landcover/tanzania_2019.tif \
~/Desktop/ --request-payer
```

    download: s3://mappingafrica/landcover/tanzania_2019.tif to ../../..
    /Desktop/tanzania_2019.tif

That will download a map of predicted landcover for Tanzania for the year 2019 
to your desktop (you might need to replace \~/ with the full path to your home
directory).

### From Box

The data may also be downloaded from a [public Box folder]
(https://airg.box.com/s/s9vhe5zy39e7oljc233n4bc3fxcow5fe).

## Viewing data

An example of how to view the data (using a Jupyter notebook) is available 
[here](https://github.com/agroimpacts/webmapper.git).
